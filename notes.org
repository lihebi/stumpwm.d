#+TITLE: Implementation notes

* TODO-list

** Fonts
In case clx-truetype is not correctly setup, I can use the terminus font.
But this is very awkward and should NOT be used.

Install by

#+begin_example
pacman -S terminus-font
#+end_example

then look into =/usr/share/fonts/misc/fonts.dir= to find the name, and put e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(set-font "-xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--32-320-72-72-c-160-iso10646-1")
#+END_SRC


** ttc fonts
Both wqy_microhei and wqy_zenhei offers ttc fonts. However, common lisp
[[https://github.com/xach/zpb-ttf][zpb-ttf]] library only supports ttf. The
NixOS package does not even copy .ttc to
=/run/current-system/sw/share/X11-fonts=.

Thus, the correct way is probably to use fontforge python interface to convert
on-the-fly from ttc to ttf? Would that result in multiple ttfs?

Currently I'm assuming =/home/hebi/.hebi/fonts= has .ttf fonts.
